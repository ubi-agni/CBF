- CBF - A Control Basis Framework Library

This is a C++-library for the control basis framework. Grupen et. al.
proposed the basic idea to factor closed loop controllers into
individual simple components. 

This software has been developed with the generous support of the
CITEC (Cognitive Interaction Technology - Center of Excellence),
which is part of the Excellence Initiative of the German Federal
Government.

- How to get the software

Install the git toolchain on you computer. Then from a console, clone
this repository:

git://github.com/fps/CBF.git

You can use e.g. this comand to check the current version of 
the software into a directory called cbf:

git clone git://github.com/fps/CBF.git cbf

- Requirements

  - A working python installation 

  - A C++ compiler that likes templates

  - the BOOST libs including the BOOST Numeric UBLAS package

- Optional Requirements

  - KDL, for KDL based inverse and forward kinematics

  - libpa10, for operating the pa10 robot arm

  - xsd, a xml schema to c++ translator. This is needed if 
    you want to be able to create controllers automatically
    from XML files

  - libxerces-c++ 2.6 or higher

  - Python C API and boost.python¸ the BOOST python bindings, 
    if you would like to be able to prototype new sensor/
    effector transforms or potential functions using 
    python code embedded into libcbf

  - Doxygen, for building the documentation

- Installation

See the INSTALL file for information on how to build and 
install the software
